- font support:
  * make the naming consistent
  * make the PDF version checking consistent
  * should cmaps internally map character codes to GIDs (instead of CIDs)?

- make sure that unit tests don't leave stray files behind
- rationalize the error handling
- make sure that supporting incremental updates to PDF files will not require
  major changes to the API

- implement CCITTFaxDecode filters
- implement public key encryption?
- implement crypt filters?
- add a way to repair broken xref tables?
