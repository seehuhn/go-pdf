- the CapHeight in SourceSerif4-Regular seems to differ between
  TrueType (670) and OpenType (800).
- Several glyphs in font/truetype/ttf/FreeMono.ttf seem to have width 0.
  Is this my bug, or theirs?  E.g. GID 0, 29, 49, 129, 133, 149, ...

- make sure that unit tests don't leave stray files behind
- rationalize the error handling
- make sure that supporting incremental updates to PDF files will not require
  major changes to the API

- implement LZWDecode filters
- implement CCITTFaxDecode filters
- implement public key encryption?
- implement crypt filters?
- add a way to repair broken xref tables?
- attempt to add pdf-2.0 support?
