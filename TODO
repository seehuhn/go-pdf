- add a slightly higher-level API for typesetting text,
  to avoid PDF output like "[-722 (1) -722] TJ" for centered text
- decide whether matrices are [6]float64 or []float64

- make sure that unit tests don't leave stray files behind
- make sure that supporting incremental updates to PDF files will not require
  major changes to the API

- implement CCITTFaxDecode filters
- implement public key encryption?
- add a way to repair broken xref tables?
