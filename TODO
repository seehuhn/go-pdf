- test that we don't write numbers like 0.6000000000000001 in content streams
- test that the widths of the notdef character is correct for the
  standard 14 fonts
- optionally write encodings that can be interpreted without reading
  the font program?
- avoid PDF output like "[-722 (1) -722] TJ" for centered text
- decide whether matrices are [6]float64 or []float64

- make sure that unit tests don't leave stray files behind
- make sure that supporting incremental updates to PDF files will not require
  major changes to the API

- implement CCITTFaxDecode filters
- implement public key encryption?
- add a way to repair broken xref tables?
