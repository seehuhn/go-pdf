Design Principles
=================

- Resources are represented by Go objects.  These objects are used
  as arguments in calls to Page methods.
- New entries are added to resource dictionaries automatically
  when a resource is used.

Types of Resources
==================

Font - A dictionary that maps resource names to font dictionaries.

ExtGState - A dictionary that maps resource names to graphics state parameter dictionaries.

XObject - A dictionary that maps resource names to external objects.

ColorSpace - A dictionary that maps each resource name to either the name of a device-dependent colour space or an array describing a colour space.

Pattern - A dictionary that maps resource names to pattern objects.

Shading - A dictionary that maps resource names to shading dictionaries.

Properties - A dictionary that maps resource names to property list dictionaries for marked-content.
