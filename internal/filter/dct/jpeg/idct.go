// Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) implementations using the algorithm from
// Christoph Loeffler, Adriaan Lightenberg, and George S. Mostchytz,
// “Practical Fast 1-D DCT Algorithms with 11 Multiplications,” ICASSP 1989.
// https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/266596
//
// Since the paper is paywalled, the rest of this comment gives a summary.
//
// A 1-dimensional forward DCT (1D FDCT) takes as input 8 values x0..x7
// and transforms them in place into the result values.
//
// The mathematical definition of the N-point 1D FDCT is:
//
//	X[k] = α_k Σ_n x[n] * cos (2n+1)*k*π/2N
//
// where α₀ = √2 and α_k = 1 for k > 0.
//
// For our purposes, N=8, so the angles end up being multiples of π/16.
// The most direct implementation of this definition would require 64 multiplications.
//
// Loeffler's paper presents a more efficient computation that requires only
// 11 multiplications and works in terms of three basic operations:
//
//  - A “butterfly” x0, x1 = x0+x1, x0-x1.
//    The inverse is x0, x1 = (x0+x1)/2, (x0-x1)/2.
//
//  - A scaling of x0 by k: x0 *= k. The inverse is scaling by 1/k.
//
//  - A rotation of x0, x1 by θ, defined as:
//    x0, x1 = x0 cos θ + x1 sin θ, -x0 sin θ + x1 cos θ.
//    The inverse is rotation by -θ.
//
// The algorithm proceeds in four stages:
//
// Stage 1:
//  - butterfly x0, x7; x1, x6; x2, x5; x3, x4.
//
// Stage 2:
//  - butterfly x0, x3; x1, x2
//  - rotate x4, x7 by 3π/16
//  - rotate x5, x6 by π/16.
//
// Stage 3:
//  - butterfly x0, x1; x4, x6; x7, x5
//  - rotate x2, x3 by 6π/16 and scale by √2.
//
// Stage 4:
//  - butterfly x7, x4
//  - scale x5, x6 by √2.
//
// Finally, the values are permuted. The permutation can be read as either:
//  - x0, x4, x2, x6, x7, x3, x5, x1 = x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7 (paper's form)
//  - x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7 = x0, x7, x2, x5, x1, x6, x3, x4 (sorted by LHS)
// The code below uses the second form to make it easier to merge adjacent stores.
// (Note that unlike in recursive FFT implementations, the permutation here is
// not always mapping indexes to their bit reversals.)
//
// As written above, the rotation requires four multiplications, but it can be
// reduced to three by refactoring (see [dctBox] below), and the scaling in
// stage 3 can be merged into the rotation constants, so the overall cost
// of a 1D FDCT is 11 multiplies.
//
// The 1D inverse DCT (IDCT) is the 1D FDCT run backward
// with all the basic operations inverted.

// dctBox implements a 3-multiply, 3-add rotation+scaling.
// Given x0, x1, k*cos θ, and k*sin θ, dctBox returns the
// rotated and scaled coordinates.
// (It is called dctBox because the rotate+scale operation
// is drawn as a box in Figures 1 and 2 in the paper.)
func dctBox(x0, x1, kcos, ksin int32) (y0, y1 int32) {
	// y0 = x0*kcos + x1*ksin
	// y1 = -x0*ksin + x1*kcos
	ksum := kcos * (x0 + x1)
	y0 = ksum + (ksin-kcos)*x1
	y1 = ksum - (kcos+ksin)*x0
	return y0, y1
}

// A block is an 8x8 input to a 2D DCT (either the FDCT or IDCT).
// The input is actually only 8x8 uint8 values, and the outputs are 8x8 int16,
// but it is convenient to use int32s for intermediate storage,
// so we define only a single block type of [8*8]int32.
//
// A 2D DCT is implemented as 1D DCTs over the rows and columns.
//
// dct_test.go defines a String method for nice printing in tests.
type block [blockSize]int32

const blockSize = 8 * 8

// Note on Numerical Precision
//
// The inputs to both the FDCT and IDCT are uint8 values stored in a block,
// and the outputs are int16s in the same block, but the overall operation
// uses int32 values as fixed-point intermediate values.
// In the code comments below, the notation “QN.M” refers to a
// signed value of 1+N+M significant bits, one of which is the sign bit,
// and M of which hold fractional (sub-integer) precision.
// For example, 255 as a Q8.0 value is stored as int32(255),
// while 255 as a Q8.1 value is stored as int32(510),
// and 255.5 as a Q8.1 value is int32(511).
// The notation UQN.M refers to an unsigned value of N+M significant bits.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format) for more.
//
// In general we only need to keep about 16 significant bits, but it is more
// efficient and somewhat more precise to let unnecessary fractional bits
// accumulate and shift them away in bulk rather than after every operation.
// As such, it is important to keep track of the number of fractional bits
// in each variable at different points in the code, to avoid mistakes like
// adding numbers with different fractional precisions, as well as to keep
// track of the total number of bits, to avoid overflow. A comment like:
//
//	// x[123] now Q8.2.
//
// means that x1, x2, and x3 are all Q8.2 (11-bit) values.
// Keeping extra precision bits also reduces the size of the errors introduced
// by using right shift to approximate rounded division.

// Constants needed for the implementation.
// These are all 60-bit precision fixed-point constants.
// The function c(val, b) rounds the constant to b bits.
// c is simple enough that calls to it with constant args
// are inlined and constant-propagated down to an inline constant.
// Each constant is commented with its Ivy definition (see robpike.io/ivy),
// using this scaling helper function:
//
//	op fix x = floor 0.5 + x * 2**60
