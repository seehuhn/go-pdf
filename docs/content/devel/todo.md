# TODO List

##Â API

- remove `pdf.Data` and use `*pdf.Writer` instead of `pdf.Putter` throughout?
- splits `pdf.Object` into a class for primitive PDF objects (just the native types),
  and a class for "objects who know how to turn themselves into PDF"?

## General

- complete the support for writing human-readable PDF files
- Make sure that readers cannot get into infinite loops when resources
  depend on each other in a cycle.
- test that we don't write numbers like `0.6000000000000001` in content streams
- By more systematic about the use of pdf.MalformedFileError, and in
  particular the `Loc` field there.
- avoid PDF output like `[-722 (1) -722] TJ` for centered text
- decide whether matrices are `[6]float64` or `[]float64`

## Fonts

- add support for external fonts
- test that the widths of the `.notdef` character is correct for the
  standard 14 fonts
- (optionally) write encodings that can be interpreted without reading
  the font program?

## Stream Filters

- implement the TIFF predictor functions for LZWDecode
- implement RunLengthDecode filters
- implement CCITTFaxDecode filters
- implement JBIG2Decode filters
- implement JPXDecode filters
- implement Crypt filters

## Features

- allow for incremental updates to PDF files?
- add a way to repair broken xref tables?
- implement public key encryption?

## Testing

- make sure that unit tests don't leave stray files behind
- when fuzzing PDF files, write the examples without compression
- look into the VeraPDF test suite
