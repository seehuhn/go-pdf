When using composite fonts in a PDF file, the glyphs to show are determined
using a multi-step process:

1. The content stream describes the text as a PDF “string”, which is a sequence
   of bytes.

2. The font's CMap describes how this byte sequence is broken into codes, and
   then maps those codes to numeric character identifiers (CIDs) within a given
   character collection. It is possible for more than one character code to map
   to the same CID.

3. The CIDs are then mapped to glyphs in the font file. There is a one-to-one
   mapping between CIDs and glyphs.

The text content of the glyphs can be specified on different levels. First, for
some standard character collections like “Adobe-Japan1”, the *CID values* have
known Unicode representations. Secondly, the font file may contain a “ToUnicode
CMap”, which maps *character codes* to Unicode values.

The file “test.pdf” generated by this example uses a composite font with
one-byte character codes, representing a subset of ASCII. The CID values chosen
are from the “Adobe-Japan1” character collection. Both uppercase and lowercase
codes are mapped to the same (uppercase) CID value. A ToUnicode CMap is used to
describe the text content for the lowercase codes, while the uppercase letters
rely on the standard interpretation of the CID values. In this scheme, the text
“Hello World” is shown as “HELLO WORLD”, but when copying and pasting the text
from a PDF viewer, the lowercase letters should be preserved.
